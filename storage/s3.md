## S3 - Simple Storage Service

### General Storage Considerations

- Minimum storage is 1 byte
- Files from 0 Bytes to 5TB
- Object based storage
- S3 is a universal namespace - namespace convention: https://s3-<region>.amazonaws.com/<nameofbucket>
- S3 is key value store: Key; Name; Version ID; Metadata and Access control list


#### Consistency

- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES, as these changes take time to propagate
- Largest object to be transferred by a PUT is 5GB

#### Tiers of Storage

- S3 (durable, immediately available, frequently accessed)
- S3 - IA (Durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed)
- S3 - Reduced Redundancy Storage (data that is easily reproducible, such as thumb nails etc.)
- Glacier - Archived data, where you can wait 3 - 5 hours before accessing





|Class|Durability (designed for)|Availability (designed for)|Other Considerations|
|----|---|---|-----|  
| STANDARD | 99.999999999% | 99.99% | None |
|STANDARD_IA | 99.999999999% | 99.9% | There is a retrieval fee associated with STANDARD_IA objects which makes it most suitable for infrequently accessed data. For pricing information, see Amazon S3 Pricing. |
| GLACIER | 99.999999999% | 99.99% (after you restore objects) |GLACIER objects are not available for real-time access. You must first restore archived objects before you can access them. For more information, see Restoring Archived Objects. |
| RRS | 99.99% | 99.99% | None |

### Security and Encryption

- By default all newly created buckets are private (no public read and write permissions)
- Access Control:
  - Bucket Policies - bucket wide Policies
  - Access Control Lists
- Can configure to create access logs
- Permissions:
  - Read and write by different groups of users



#### Securing buckets

- Access controls lists can be applied to buckets using:
  - Bucket Policies
  - ACLs
- S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the s3 bucket, this can be done to another bucket


#### Encryption Strategies

- 2 States:
  - In transit, SSL/TLS
  - At Rest:
    - Server side encryption:
      - s3 managed keys (SSE-S3 AES-256);
      - AWS Key Management Service (managed keys) SSE-KMS. Can provide key logs of who was using the keys
      - Customer provided keys (SSE-C)
    - Client side encryption - data encrypted before uploading to S3


### Life Cycle Management and Versioning

- Can be used with versioning (applied to current versions and previous versions)
- Versioning:
  - Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
  - once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended.
  - Versioning MFA can be used to provide additional security of items stored in the buckets
  - Cross Region Replication requires versioning
- Actions:
  - Transition to the Standard - Infrequent Access Storage Class (128kb and 30 days after creation date)
  - Archive to Glacier Storage Class (30 days after transferring to Infrequent Access Class Storage)
  - Then permanently delete 60 or more days after transferring to Glacier

###  S3 - Transfer Acceleration

- Uses CloudFront to transfer to an edge location
- Uses distinct URL to enable transfer to edge location

### Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- needs to be enabled on the resources bucket and the URL of the origin that will be calling the bucket needs to be specified
- S3 website bucket namespace: http://<bucketname>.s3-website.<region>.amazonaws.com
