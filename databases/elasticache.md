## Elasticache

- used to reduce latency and improve through put for read intense applications (websites, social networking) or compute heavy operations
- stores recently accessed data in-memory for lower latency access

Two types:

1. Memcache:
- object caching system
- protocol compliant with Memcached

2. Redis: 
- in memory key-value store that supports sorted sets and lists
- supports slave-master replication and Multi-AZ functionality to improve redundancy
