#### Management Roles Lab:

- Apply roles to EC2 instances during creation so credentials do not need to be stored on the EC2 instance
- Roles more secure than storing access key and secret access key on individual EC2 instance
- Roles are easier to manage - role permissions can be updated
- Roles are universal, can use them in any region
