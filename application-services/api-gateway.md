### API Gateway

- API Gateway allows for the creation of APIs that act as an entry point for applications to access data or business logic
- API caching: caching the endpoints response - e.g. same information made to API Gateway -> same response
- can throttle requests made to prevent attacks
- ties in with CORS (cross origin resource sharing), which allows restricted resources from a page to be requested from another domain, outside the domain from which the first resource was served. Enable this on API gateway if there is an error involving requests from external domains
